## How it works

<!---Explain how your project works:--> 
It is a 4 bit full adder with carry in and carry out along with two 4 bit inputs and one 4 bit output 

## How to test

<!--Explain how to use your project:-->
Use it to find the sum of two four bit numbers with a resultant 4 bit sum vector and a carry bit

## External hardware

Any LEDs can be used to show the output bits of the sum and the carry. The inputs can be driven by a set of slide switches.
